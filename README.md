Welcome to the **Multiverse Linear Regression Model**, a powerful machine learning engine designed to predict house prices across countless theoretical housing markets!

In our multiverse, every universe has its own unique set of economic rules and realities. This model doesn't just predict prices in our Boston—it's built to **generalize across multiple dimensions** of housing data. By analyzing key interdimensional factors like room quantity (`RM`), neighborhood socioeconomic status (`LSTAT`), and educational quality (`PTRATIO`), it calculates a stable price point that holds value across realities.

This project uses **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**, a foundational supervised learning algorithm. The model establishes a linear relationship between the target variable (house price) and multiple predictor variables (features).

The learned equation takes the form:
`Price = θ₀ + θ₁*RM + θ₂*LSTAT + θ₃*PTRATIO`
How to Use
1. Explore the Multiverse: Use the sliders to define the characteristics of a house in a new universe.
2.  Run the Prediction: The model will use its interdimensional equation to compute a stable price.
3.  Analyze the Result: See how the fundamental laws of real estate apply, no matter which dimension you're in
